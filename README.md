# Air-pollution-in-HaNoi

### Overview
An analysis in air quality, from the raw data including factors contributing to air pollution (CO, NO, pm10, pm25), temperatures, wind speed and humidity. Following that, predict the AQI (Air Quality Index) for each hour in the next 30 days. 

### Skills and Techniques
- Machine Learning
- Data preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Time Series: An application of Machine Learning in the real world which is a set of observations recored over time. In this data, the data are recorded hourly for forecasting.

### Libraries/Framework
- Python: Main programming for project
- Numpy: Handling multi-dimensions array
- Pandas: Using for analysis and data preprocessing
- Scikit-learn: Import models and accuracy metrics
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualizing data.
